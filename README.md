# CS 122 Project
Project Title: SJSU Parking Tracker

Authors: Hardeep Kainth, Ynha Nguyen

# Project Outline and Plan

## Interface Plan
For our interface, we will be using a GUI using Python’s Tkinter library. Our home screen will include various widgets, including 3 buttons for fetching data, viewing the data analysis, and visualizing the data. The data can be viewed through another pop up window. We will also include a drop down window to filter through specific parking garages and time ranges.

## Data Analysis and Visualization Plan
Data Analysis: To analyze our data, we will calculate trends using Python’s Pandas library. Because this library is ideal for handling data in CSV files, we can use Pandas to read through our data and analyze it by calculating various statistics, such as parking availability averages and trends throughout the day. Pandas also works well with Matplotlib which will make visualizing and plotting our data more efficient.

Data Visualization: Our visualization component will plot the data for parking availability depending on the time and parking garage. Using Matplotlib, we will make a times series plot to visualize parking availability throughout the day and a bar chart to visualize the parking availability based on each garage.
